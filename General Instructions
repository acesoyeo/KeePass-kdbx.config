If you have a PPK (PuTTY Private Key) file and you want to convert it to an OpenSSH private key format (id_rsa) on a Linux system, you can use the puttygen tool, which is part of the PuTTY suite. Follow these steps:

Install PuTTY on Linux:

If you don't have PuTTY tools installed on your Linux system, you can install them. On Debian/Ubuntu-based systems, you can use:

bash
$sudo apt-get update
$sudo apt-get install putty-tools

On Red Hat/Fedora-based systems, you can use:
bash
$sudo dnf install putty

Convert PPK to id_rsa:

Once PuTTY tools are installed, you can use puttygen to convert the PPK file to the OpenSSH format. Assuming your PPK file is named your_key.ppk, use the following command:

bash
$puttygen your_key.ppk -O private-openssh -o your_key_rsa
Replace your_key.ppk with the actual name of your PPK file and your_key_rsa with the desired name for the output OpenSSH private key file.

Set Correct Permissions:

Ensure that the newly generated your_key_rsa file has the correct permissions. The OpenSSH private key file should have restrictive permissions for security reasons:

bash
$chmod 600 your_key_rsa
Use the Converted Key:

You can now use the converted your_key_rsa file with the standard OpenSSH tools. For example, to SSH into a machine:

bash
$ssh -i your_key_rsa user@hostname
Replace user with your username and hostname with the target machine's IP address or domain name.

That's it! You have successfully converted a PPK file to an OpenSSH private key on a Linux system using puttygen.
